Each project includes a brief description and a link to its live demo (if available) or its GitHub repository.

This project is a menu used to order pizza 
with a various selection of toppings.  It then takes the toppings and information input and then calculates a price for the order.

<h1><strong>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</strong></h1>

The classic game of tic-tac-toe.
 It randomly rolls dice to select which one of the two players goes first and then users are off playing the classic game. 
 Users can decide which token ("X" or "O") each player wants to use and the winner is celebrated with music and flashing lights.

<h1><strong>Calculator</strong></h1>
A basic 4 function calculator.
Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
